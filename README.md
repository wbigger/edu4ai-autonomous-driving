# EDU4AI - Autonomous Driving Cars

This tutorial is part of the following EU funded project:

Edu4AI - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to Foster 21st Century Skills in Secondary Education, in the framework of Erasmus+, Grant Agreement VG-IN-BY-20-25-077366


# Final result

# Get the parts
For our project we used the following parts
- [ ] Raspberry Pi version 4
- [ ] MicroSD card minimum size 16 GB
- [ ] Two wheels with rubber tires
- [ ] L298N Motor Drive Controller
- [ ] USB 5V power bank
- [ ] 9V battery with clip
- [ ] USB webcam with hole for tripod
- [ ] Jumper wires F/F and F/M, to connect everything
- [ ] M2.5 and M3 screws, assorted lengths
- [ ] double-sided tape or Patafix
- [ ] 1/4" slotted screw (for camera)
- [ ] ball castor (we used a two-holes ball castor, with distance of 38mm between them)
- [ ] a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable or adapter to connect your Raspberry to a monitor

Optional:
- [ ] Raspberry case

Just as reference, you can see the list part [here](https://www.amazon.it/hz/wishlist/ls/2XP57TFXQNB8H?ref_=wl_share).

## Chassis
For the chassis, we created [this](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/15c321ccd0213a232c1b2dd5/w/b4b8e765f4b619d71b8de61f/e/8b93bb84c32f0defb354983d?renderMode=0&uiState=627d060678688a1df5b7ed36) project using OnShape. OnShape is a completely online CAD, free to use for students and educators. 

We printed the chassis with common PLA. 

The chassis is far to be perfect, could be largely improved. We favored simplicity for 3D printing, using a single part and a flat side to adhere to the build plate. Please feel free to modify it according to your needs.
