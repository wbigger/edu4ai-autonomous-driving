# Robot chassis

For the chassis, we created this project using OnShape. OnShape is a completely online CAD, free to use for students and educators.

We printed the chassis with common PLA.

The chassis is far to be perfect, could be largely improved. We favored simplicity for 3D printing, using a single part and a flat side to adhere to the build plate. Please feel free to modify it according to your needs.
