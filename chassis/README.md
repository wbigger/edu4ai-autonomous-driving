# Robot chassis

For the chassis, we created [this](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/15c321ccd0213a232c1b2dd5/w/b4b8e765f4b619d71b8de61f/e/8b93bb84c32f0defb354983d?renderMode=0&uiState=627d060678688a1df5b7ed36) project using OnShape. OnShape is a completely online CAD, free to use for students and educators.

In this folder you can also find the STL version of the main revisions.

We printed the chassis with common PLA.

The chassis is far to be perfect, could be largely improved. We favored simplicity for 3D printing, using a single part and a flat side to adhere to the build plate. Please feel free to modify it according to your needs.
